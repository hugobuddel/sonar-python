<p>Any statement, other than a <code>pass</code>, <code>...</code> (ellipsis) or an empty statement (i.e. a single semicolon "<code>;</code>"), which
has no side effect and does not result in a change of control flow will normally indicate a programming error, and therefore should be refactored.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
a == 1 # Noncompliant; was assignment intended?
a &lt; b # Noncompliant; have we forgotten to assign the result to a variable?
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p><strong>Strings</strong></p>
<p>Some projects use string literals as comments. By default this rule will raise an issue on these strings. This can be disabled by setting the rule
parameter "reportOnStrings" to "false".</p>
<pre>
class MyClass:
    myattr = 42
    """This is an attribute"""  # Noncompliant by default. Set "reportOnStrings" to "false"
</pre>
<p><strong>Operators</strong></p>
<p>By default, this rule considers that no arithmetic operator has a side effect. Some rare projects redefine operators and add a side effect. You can
list such operators in the rule parameter "ignoredOperators".</p>
<pre>
def process(p, beam):
    """
    Apache Beam redefines "|" and "&gt;&gt;" operators and they have a side effect.
    Thus for Apache Beam projects "ignoredOperators"should be set to "|,&gt;&gt;"
    """
    p | "create" &gt;&gt; beam.Create()  # Noncompliant by default
</pre>
